## Description
GuLongQunXiaZhuan is a old Chinese RPG game. Unlike most of the old games, which can be simply modified through tool like CheatEngine, this game has encrypted its values so it's not easy to cheat. This simple tool just uses the same encryption algorithm to calculate the encrypted value from the original value. So you can search the encrypted values through CheatEngine as usual.
